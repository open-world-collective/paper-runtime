# Paper Runtime Charter

## Mission

Provide stable, observable Minecraft-compatible Paper runtime operations while defining interfaces that can later support engine-agnostic infrastructure.

## Guardrails

- Reliability before feature volume
- Explicit plugin/runtime boundaries
- Reproducible setup and rollback

## 12-month outcomes

- Production-grade runbooks and backup discipline
- Stable plugin API surface for world powers
- Measured migration plan from Minecraft-specific assumptions

## Legal note

This charter describes technical governance only; it does not establish a legal foundation entity.
