# paper-runtime

Vanilla-compatible Paper runtime and operations repo for Open World Collective.

## Current scope

- Paper runtime packaging and operational scripts
- Plugin workspace for world powers and governance hooks
- Deployment, backups, observability, and incident runbooks

## Explicit non-goals (for now)

- Not a Paper fork yet
- Not an engine-agnostic runtime yet

## Near-term priorities

1. Reliable local and hosted runtime boot flows
2. Plugin interface boundaries for world powers
3. Reproducible ops and rollback playbooks

## Relationship to enderterm

`enderterm` is world interface/tooling, not gameplay client runtime.
