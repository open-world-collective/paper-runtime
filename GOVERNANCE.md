# Governance

## Structure

- Maintainers manage merge decisions and release cadence.
- Contributors submit issues/PRs with tests and operational notes.

## Decision process

- Default: maintainer consensus in issue/PR thread.
- If blocked: short RFC issue with explicit options and decision date.
- Tie-breaker: two-maintainer sign-off.

## Transparency

- Technical decisions are logged in issues/PRs.
- Security-sensitive details are handled privately, then summarized publicly after mitigation.

## Authority boundaries

This repo is run by an engineering collaboration team and is not a legal foundation entity.
